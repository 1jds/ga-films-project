# General Assembly Homework Task to Build a Film Info Previewer

This repository hosts the code for a homework task completed as part of a General Assembly React course. Note that about 20% of this task was pre-written and scaffolded by the General Assembly instructor. For example, the color-scheme, and basic layout were not designed by me. On the other hand, some of the original code was refactored, and all of the React/JS is my own.

Here is an illustrative image of the project running on http://localhost:3000/

## How this project could be improved
- Make use of TypeScript (e.g. to check API data received for consistency, since I do not control the API and the kinds of data which it emits may be altered by the owner without my knowledge, leading to unexpected bugs in the project).
